This is the repository for the website and notes of the AMC 10/12 preparation club hosted by Alex G. Wang, Victor W. Zhou, Andrew K. Liu and S. Zhang at SZMS.

If you are looking for the website of AMC Club (for notes packets, etc), please click the link above.

The docs folder contains all of the files that are publicly visible on the homepage. The source folder contains the markdown source files used to generate these PDFs. Some of the PDFs were generated in Google Docs instead of Markdown, and are not included here.
